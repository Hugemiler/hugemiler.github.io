As a canine scholar, my research focuses on the intricate dynamics of tail wagging as a form of communication and its interactions with acquiring dental sticks from owners.  Through rigorous investigation and analysis, I seek to unravel the mysteries behind the various nuances of tail wagging to improve the likelihood of additional dental stick deployments.
