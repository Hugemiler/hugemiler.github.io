<font size="5"> I am Finnigan a dog that has no job but wants to work in the [Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) under the supervision of [Dr. Curtis Huttenhower](https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/home).

My research is currently focused on how to get my owners to give me as many dental sticks as possible. I also enjoy long walks in the woods and playing at the dog park. I have a sister named Mango who can be mean to me at times but I still love her very much  </font>
